Key concepts;

> *Artificial* is defined as something made or produced by human beigns rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural.

**Artificial intelligence** can be defined in simple term as a branch of computer science that is concerned with the creation of systems that can simulate human intelligence. In a lay man language, artificial means man made stuffs or anything that is non natural, hence AI is the similtude or replica  of human intelligence in machines with software capabilities.

***Machine learning*** is a branch of Artificial intelligence that is concerned with the use of special algorithms to gain meaningful information,gain insights, hidden patterns etc based on a set of data given.
Application of machine learning is now almost every where. A very good example of the application of machine learning is the ***Youtube's Recommender system***. One of the first ML predictive algorithms applied to Youtube was collaborative filtering, recommends videos based on a user's viewing history and over time, typically becomes very accurate at predicting what a useer wants to watch.

# The History of AI
+ In 1950, Alan Turing started to think about the possibility of creating machines that think. He craeted the popularly known Turing test.
  
+ In 1956 Dartmouth summer reasearch project where the name AI was coined.
  "The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on artificial intelligence was a seminal event for artificial intelligence as a field," and it was here that the term 'artificial intelligence' was coined, The seminar was led by professor ***John McCarthy***
+ In 1956-1974 known as the golden years, this was when the Gold rush of AI was seen. Reasearch was well funded by government agencies. Research was well funded by government agencies, advances were made in computation and algorithms, and prototypes of intelligent machines were built. Some of these machines include ***Shakey the robot***, ***Eliza, a chatbot***, ***"Blocks world"***
+ In 1974-1980 was the AI winter, when funding of AI projects stopped. This was due to some critical issues such as   
    - Scarcity of data
    - Computer power was very low
    - The amount of parameters needed to be trained grew exponentially as more was asked of computers, without a parallel evolution of compute power and capability.
+ 1980s Expert systems.Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software, its benefit to business became so apparent.
+ 1987 - 1993: AI 'Chill'
+ 1993 - 2011
